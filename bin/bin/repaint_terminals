# Update colours using ANSI escape sequences
# ======================================================================


# Use ANSI codes to apply theme change to all active terminals.  This is
# particularly useful for programs that source their colours at startup,
# requiring a restart to apply a new theme.  All terminals I have tested
# respond to the live theme change.  Tried with xterm, rxvt-unicode,
# {gnome,mate,xfce4}-terminal, kitty, tilix.

# The ANSI escape sequences are defined in this document
