# SXHKD module with WM-agnostic keys
#

# Index with key chord chain mnemonics
# ====================================
#
# Key chord chains are used for less common or ancillary commands, or
# for when assigning direct keybindings would become unwieldy. The idea
# is to scope bindings so as to avoid conflicts.

# Environment: super + e ; ...
# Executables which typically run in the console: super + x ; ...
# Graphical applications: super + g ; ...
# Assign (node flags): super + a ; ...
# Split (split ratios): super + s ; ...

# Environment
# -----------

# The following commands are:
#
# c == toggle compton (display compositor)
# d == dmenu to quickly edit dotfiles
# f == bspwm focus mode
# s == reload sxhkd
# p == reload melonpanel (my lemonbar script)
# t == dmenu to choose Tempus theme
# q == dmenu interface to log out, lock, switch users, reboot, shutdown
# x == reload the Xresources file

# Main programs
# -------------

# Terminal emulator with and without TMUX. I normally use `tmux` which
# is ideal for working on multiple terminals, switching sessions, and
# the like. I think it fits perfectly into a console-based workflow and
# complements the features of a tiling WM. No need to spawn tens of
# terminals, like a barbarian! Watch my screen cast on the matter:
