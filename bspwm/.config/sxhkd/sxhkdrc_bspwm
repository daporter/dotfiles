# Swap focused window with the one in the given direction. If there is
# no window in that direction, a receptacle will be created. Inputting
# any direction again will move the focused window to the position of
# the receptacle. This will effectively remove it from the current
# layout, creating a more fluid workflow that does not constrain you to
# the tree of the tiling scheme.
#
# IF you only ever want to move a window into an existing one and avoid
# the added features of the scripted behaviour, use the following
# command instead:
#
#       bspc node -s {west,south,north,east}
#
# TIP after breaking free from the layout, you can use --balance to
# spread out the nodes (see the key chord further down). You may also
# --rotate the tree.

# dimensions and can be stacked on top of each other.
